So what's new in the latest update of mine?
# • New UI
> Axa our other developer for TJM did not like the current UI we had and if I'm being real I did not like it as well,
> so Axa developed thr Coin and Temperature icons and mechanics :D
# • Landmines
> Finally made, there crafted with, ``1x Redstone, 3x Iron Ingots and 5x Gunpowder``, they have

> craft a bundle with ``10x String`` and throw everything out at once onto the crafter!
# • More Land
> Currently trying to finalise a few more areas I need to work on before adding some main key features
> needed for the game, there's also a new town in the works that does not have a name yet.
# • Cosy Armor
> A new low-tier Armor has been added which costs 5k and

## • RNG spawn and Selected spawn

## • Normal & Cult Caves
> Mining and Cult caves in TJM were one of the main features everyone enjoyed, so i want to create a bunch of caves,
> from small to large, from easy to hard, a variety of caves that all different types of players can go find and explore!

## • Item Crafting
> Crafting in TJM is going to be one of its core mechanics, for example if you have not been to testing nights, if you find
> a stick you can go to a crafter, throw your broken sword and stick on it and boom! you have a normal wooden sword!

## • Terrain & Locations
> To make this server truly immersive there will be different locations all with there own jobs and shops, allowing
> for every player to play the game in there own unique way, this will help make the server more unique.  

## • Jobs
> Jobs are the best efficient way to earn money, i'd like to make more jobs which will promote diffrent playstyles for TJM,
> some shops will even have Owners with their own voice lines, but I'm not saying who!
