Made some small GUI changes including the pause menu
since that used to glitch out a lot when in the server (color-wise)

Also designed a sign for the flakestop shop, i will be upgrading
these signs to a higher quality once i get better at pixel art :)

Alright so i've not done much this day apart from make a sellable item.
@Grandmaster40 pointed out to me in the alpha testing that i
forgot to add a shop were you can sell berries, so i've just spent around
2 hours to learn item_displays to make this :D

Would you guys like it if i made more of these custom signs? üëÄ

# TJM Frostbite | Dev-log 7 | 30/01/2024
Alright so the Alpha Testing last night showed me some bugs that i needed to fix,
so here's everything I have fixed :)

‚Ä¢ Glitched Trees.
‚Ä¢ Delivery "UI Display Timer".
‚Ä¢ Raw Copper Iron And Gold blocks.
‚Ä¢ Player Temprature resetting upon new person Joining.
‚Ä¢ Swords now deal damage instead of having the "0 DMG".
‚Ä¢ Lanterns are only given to you on the first spawn.
‚Ä¢ Spawn Pickaxes Buffed to mine coal.
‚Ä¢ Most items you spawn with now have "Vanishing".

Today i got the ball rolling in terms of TJM development by starting on
developing the shops, as you guys have probably heard i have been planning
to add "stocks" into the game.

When a player buys something the stock of that shop goes down by 1,
when a player does a delivery for the shop, it goes up by 10,
Once the stock is 0 nothing can be bought, until theres more in stock.

I was thinking of making it that the more expensive/valueable the item is,
the more stock it removes at once, do you guys think this a good idea? (‚úÖ/‚ùé )

# TJM Frostbite | Dev-log 3 | 08/12/2023
