Welcome to logs, basically if your going to change something you can add a small breif about it here,
also please fill in the dates when you add a log, its just helpful, this will also be used to see
how far we have developed TJM frostbite and is something we can look back on and laugh about.

JM: Alright so today i've made the Resource pack cleaned and i'm thinking of passing it over to you so you
    can fix the fucking horrible crossbow json i cannot bare to look at, im also thinking we should add custom
    enchants and types of crossbows since they were VERY iconic in TJM :))

    I have yet to use the script you have made me since i'm very scared of having the ugly scuffed JSON stuff to
    deal with but apart from that i'm feeling somewhat confident, how this message finds you well! :D

JM: Holy shit time flies i just got back to working on the pack, we both just got git working which is nice and i
    just added JMs health = speed mechanic, im going to make temperature work in the game though your prooobbbabllyy gonna
    have to optimise it because last time it was a train wreck, im also allowing LostPuppet to help with the enchantments
    since hes VERY good at that stuff :D

JM: Alright so i've did some small play testing with Aron, Woag and Gamer, fishing works really well and rare items are well, rare.
    though aron said that the resting mechanic is not the best still, maybe i'll make it so the more you run the slower you get every
    100 "cassie.stamina" and then increase the recovery time by +2 seconds, so if your "C.S" is 600 you'd need to rest for 12 seconds.
    Cassie's sprint mechanic also spams recovery/succsessful and type/no_stamina which is an issue, i also need to change the "breathing sfx"

    JMs speed system seems to be fine right now since there have been no complaints, our next steps are probably to get a shop generator working
    a pickaxe generator and a parry system for the swords working :))

    I'm writing this on the 16th meaning i'll be on holiday tomorrow, before i sleep though i'm going to test your regenerating blocks. ^^

JM: Writing this quickly before i send push it over to axa, i really cannot believe the last log of mine was done before i went on holiday, i feel
like i should be posting in the logs more, currently we have stamina, final stands and parrying working which im really happy about that.}

I feel like i have brain damage and Axa is leading my through it all since i don't remember jackshit, somewhat worried shes gonna snap on me soon ^^'
